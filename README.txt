Before attempting to download/install these packages to work with the Jaguar robot, please ensure that:

1. You have properly installed and configured the correct version of ROS for the Jaguar (ROS 1 Noetic); if not, please refer to https://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu on how to do so.

2. You have properly configured your catkin workspace; if not, please refer to https://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace on how to do so.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you have downloaded the files, make sure that you have unzipped any of the .zip files; these are packages that are required dependencies for some of the other packages that the Jaguar relies on.
